# coding-projects
Some of the coding projects I did to practice programming. Most of them will be done in react.js or JavaScript

timer_part2
  a poor name, but it's my first project done on my own (what I'm trying to say is - I'm a bad godmother, I don't know how to name things). It is a stopwatch. It has one button that changes to start or to stop depending whether the stopwatch is active or not.
