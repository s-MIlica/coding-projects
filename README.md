# coding-projects
Some of the coding projects I did to practice programming. Most of them will be done in react.js or JavaScript

stopwatch
  This is my first project done on my own - a stopwatch. It has one button that changes to start or to stop depending whether the stopwatch is active or not. 

coffee_timer
 a simple timer - put in minutes and/or seconds, click start and when the countdown ends a pop-up will appear and old school bell will ring. The timer has a pause button if the timer is running, as well as stop button. An Add One Minute button is also there. It is called coffee timer because it is made for those who put water for coffee on the stove and then forget about it, but if you'd like to make a tea this timer will be useful as well!

calculator
 what the name says - a calculator! It was a quick project I did one night when I was bored. The calculator does basic functions (+ - * /), it has a '.' button for decimals as well as '(' and ')' buttons. If you make a mistake 'delete' button is here to help you, and if you are done you can clear the whole display with 'C' button. (very minimal css, hasn't been made to be responsive [yet!])
