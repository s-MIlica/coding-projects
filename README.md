# coding-projects
Some of the coding projects I did to practice programming. Most of them will be done in react.js or JavaScript

timer_try2
  a poor name, but it's my first project done on my own (what I'm trying to say is - I'm a bad godmother, I don't know how to name things). It is a stopwatch. It has one button that changes to start or to stop depending whether the stopwatch is active or not. 

coffee_timer
 a simple timer - put in minutes and/or seconds click start and when the countdown ends a pop will appear. It is called coffee timer because it is made for those who put water for coffee on the stove and then forget about it, but if you'd like to make a tea this timer will be useful as well!
