# coding-projects
Some of the coding projects I did to practice programming. Most of them will be done in react.js or JavaScript <br>

stopwatch <br>
  This is my first project done on my own - a stopwatch. It has one button that changes to start or to stop depending whether the stopwatch is active or not. 

coffee_timer <br>
 a simple timer - put in minutes and/or seconds, click START and when the countdown ends an old school bell will ring and you'll get a message on screen that your coffee is ready. <br>
The timer has a PAUSE button - but it is only visible if the timer is running, as well as STOP/RESET button. After the countdown has ended and the bells starts to ring, to shut it up click STOP/RESET button. <br>
An Add One Minute (+1') button is also there if you need to, well, add one minute to the timer. <br>
 It is called coffee timer because it is made for those who put water for coffee on the stove and then forget about it, but if you'd like to make a tea this timer will be useful as well!
<br> (css is a little bit wonky, as I'm still honing my designing abilities) <br>

calculator <br>
 what the name says - a calculator! It was a quick project I did one night when I was bored. The calculator does basic functions (+ - * /), it has a '.' button for decimals as well as '(' and ')' buttons. If you make a mistake 'delete' button is here to help you, and if you are done you can clear the whole display with 'C' button.  <br>
(very minimal css, hasn't been made to be responsive [yet!]) 
<br>(also, .eval() function was used for this)
