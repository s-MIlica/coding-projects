# coding-projects
Some of the coding projects I did to practice programming. Most of them will be done in react.js or JavaScript

stopwatch
  This is my first project done on my own - a stopwatch. It has one button that changes to start or to stop depending whether the stopwatch is active or not. 

coffee_timer <br>
 a simple timer - put in minutes and/or seconds, click start and when the countdown ends an old school bell will ring and you'll get a message on screen that your coffee is ready. <br>
The timer has a pause button - if the timer is running, as well as stop/reset button. After the countdown has ended and the bells starts to ring, to shut it up click stop/reset button. An Add One Minute button is also there if you need to, well, add one minute to the timer. <br>
 It is called coffee timer because it is made for those who put water for coffee on the stove and then forget about it, but if you'd like to make a tea this timer will be useful as well!
<br> (css is a little bit wonky, as I'm still honing my designing abilities) <br>

calculator
 what the name says - a calculator! It was a quick project I did one night when I was bored. The calculator does basic functions (+ - * /), it has a '.' button for decimals as well as '(' and ')' buttons. If you make a mistake 'delete' button is here to help you, and if you are done you can clear the whole display with 'C' button. (very minimal css, hasn't been made to be responsive [yet!]) (also, .eval() function was used for this)
